    <h1>Exploring the World of Literature</h1>
    <p>
        Classic novels have had a profound impact on literature, shaping the way stories are told and influencing
        countless generations of writers. Works like <strong>Don Quixote</strong> by Miguel de Cervantes and
        <strong>Jane Eyre</strong> by Charlotte Brontë introduced complex characters and themes that explored the human
        condition in groundbreaking ways. The novel <strong>Moby-Dick</strong> by Herman Melville delved into the
        struggle between man and nature, while <strong>1984</strong> by George Orwell raised important questions about
        the dangers of totalitarianism. These books have become timeless, not only because of their <em>narrative
            innovation</em> but also for their deep exploration of <em>identity, morality, and social structures</em>,
        which continue to resonate with readers across time and culture.
